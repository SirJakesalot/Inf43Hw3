    This will be able to be used to determine the "lag time" of actions like
    voting, reports, and mod actions.

    Event add_target_fields: minor logic refactoring
    
    This logic was starting to get a little tangled in here with some
    unrelated things being mixed together, so this just splits it out so
    that each check is self-contained and only related to the things
    actually being added at that time.

    stats: Don't swallow exceptions in timer context manager.
    
    The return value of the __exit__ function of a context manager is only
    used for its truthiness to determine if any exceptions within the "with"
    block should be swallowed.
    
    From PEP-0343:
    
        IMPORTANT: if mgr.__exit__() returns a "true" value, the exception
        is "swallowed".
    
    Since the timer was returning "self" which evaluates truthily, any
    exceptions inside a timer "with" block would be swallowed. Scary!
